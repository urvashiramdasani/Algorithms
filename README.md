This repository holds all implementations of algorithms taught in the course of DS and Algo Foundations by GeeksforGeeks. The topics covered under this course are Sorting, Searching,
Hashing, Greedy Algorithms, Dynamic Programming and Backtracking. If you find any better algorithm than coded here, feel free to contact me! I have also added my notes from the course.
